When given an input of list of numbers, this method will find the longest sequence of numbers that are equal. 
For example, in [6, 7, 4, 4, 4, 7, 1, 3, 3, 4, 1, 4, 3, 4, 2, 9, 1, 8, 2, 7], the longest sequence is 4, 4, 4.
The method would return [4, 4, 4]. If there are ties, return the first one encountered assuming the list is traversed from lowest to highest index.
